# Hand Gesture Recognition Using Wi-Fi RSSI Data

This repository contains the implementation of a hand gesture recognition system using Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) data. The project leverages machine learning techniques to classify gestures such as `Swipe`, `Push-Pull`, and `Circular`.

## Introduction

Wi-Fi-based gesture recognition explores the potential of RSSI data for non-invasive and touchless human activity recognition. This system:
- Captures Wi-Fi RSSI data during hand gestures.
- Preprocesses the data to ensure temporal continuity and remove noise.
- Applies machine learning models to classify gestures with high accuracy.

## Features

- RSSI data collection using Wi-Fi scanning APIs.
- Data preprocessing, including resampling, smoothing, and interpolation.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
- Machine learning pipelines using models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, and Stacking Ensemble.
- Comprehensive evaluation with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `tqdm`
- LaTeX for report generation (optional)
